## Poker Bot for Reddit

Created a bot using `PRAW` for `Python` hosted on `AWS EC2`. The bot
takes poker hand input in the form of a reddit comment and replies with
the odds of winning for the hand in question.


The bot uses Monte Carlo method and estimates an odd of winning by
simulating multiple random hands and calculating the odds of winning.
